# clickygame

This is Clickygame! A memory game where a user can go in and has the choice between 15 different photos to click on. Each time they click on an image, they receive 1 point, as long as the image is different and has not already been selected. The order of the images will move after each click is performed. If you click on an image that has previously been selected, the game will reset and the score will go back to 0.
